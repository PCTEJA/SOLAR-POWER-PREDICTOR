The Project addresses the problem of short-term renewable energy forecasting. The stochastic nature of renewable energy sources affects the power system planning procedures, subsequently reducing the reliability and security of power supply for final customers. I propose a machine learning approach for effective day-ahead forecasting using retrospective metering data and open source weather information provided by meteorological services. The Project addresses the problem of feature identification and appropriate error metrics. For the purpose of effective testing the user interface is created and tested on the real solar power plant situated in southern region of Russian Federation. The mean forecasting accuracy was obtained to be about 93%.
